# Archived VAHC homepages

This repository contains all the VAHC homepages since 2010.
As the large file size of past homepages (e.g., proceedings, program, and images), the compile time of the homepage project may be up to 20 mins due to file copying.
To address the issue of redundant copying, past homepages are moved to this repository.

You can visit [https://visualanalyticshealthcare.github.io/archive/2021/] to access the archived homepage of VAHC 2021. 
For other years, just change the year in the URL.

The main homepage has a seperate page to link all archived homepages, so you can also access past homepage from there.
