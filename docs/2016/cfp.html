<h1> Call for Papers</h1>
<p> 
The 2016 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2016) is the seventh annual workshop that provides an opportunity for participants to discuss state-of-the-art data visualization techniques and review how such techniques can be applied to healthcare data. The primary objective of the annual workshop is to bring together medical experts, leading scientists, and visionaries to discuss visualization techniques that can be applied to healthcare data and discuss the areas of healthcare that need more attention from the visualization and visual data mining communities. The workshop will allow participants to showcase their ongoing work on visual analytics of healthcare-related data through podium, posters, or demo presentations as well as to learn more about emerging techniques, software applications, and datasets. </br></br>

This year the VAHC 2016 workshop will be co-located with the 2016 American Medical Informatics Association (<a href="https://www.amia.org/amia2016">AMIA</a>) Annual Symposium in Chicago, Illinois. </p>
