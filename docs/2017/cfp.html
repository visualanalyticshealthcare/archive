<h1>CALL FOR PAPERS, POSTERS, and DEMONSTRATIONS</h1>
<h4>2017 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare </h4>
(Affiliated with IEEE VIS 2017, October 1st, Phoenix, Arizona)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Website:</b> <a href="http://visualanalyticshealthcare.org/">http://visualanalyticshealthcare.org/</a>

<h1> Call for Papers</h1>
<p>
The 2017 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2017) is the eighth annual workshop that provides an opportunity for participants to discuss state-of-the-art data visualization techniques and review how such techniques can be applied to healthcare data. The primary objective of the annual workshop is to bring together medical experts, leading scientists, and visionaries to discuss visualization techniques that can be applied to healthcare data and discuss the areas of healthcare that need more attention from the visualization and visual data mining communities. The workshop will allow participants to showcase their ongoing work on visual analytics of healthcare-related data through podium, posters, or demo presentations as well as to learn more about emerging techniques, software applications, and datasets. In years past, demos of prototype and/or production visual analytics software have been particularly well received, and paper submitters should also consider submitting a companion demo proposal.
<br><br>

During the last seven years the Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC) has been organized and hosted annually. The VAHC workshop has been hosted four times at the IEEE VIS conference (2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015) and three times at the AMIA Annual Symposium (2013, 2014, and 2016). This year the VAHC 2017 workshop is held in conjunction with the IEEE VIS conference in Phoenix, Arizona. For information about all previous VAHC events and to access the open-access proceedings from each of the previous workshops, please see <a href="prev_VAHC.html">past events</a>.
