          <p style="font-size: 125%; margin-top: -20px;">We are accepting posters for both original work, and for work
            previously accepted elsewhere -- or
            concurrently at VIS this year -- to foster increased discussion and dissemination of ideas from a wide
            variety

      <h1> Call for Papers</h1>
      <p>The 2019 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2019) is the tenth annual workshop that provides an
        opportunity for participants to discuss state-of-the-art data visualization techniques and review how such
        techniques can be applied to healthcare data. The primary objective of the annual workshop is to bring together
        medical experts, leading scientists, and visionaries to discuss visualization techniques that can be applied to
        healthcare data and discuss the areas of healthcare that need more attention from the visualization and visual
        data mining communities. The workshop will enable participants to showcase their ongoing work on visual
        analytics of healthcare-related data through podium, posters, or demo presentations as well as to learn more
        about emerging techniques, software applications, and datasets. In years past, demos of prototype and/or
        production visual analytics software have been particularly well received, and paper submitters should also
        consider submitting a companion demo proposal.
        <br><br>
        During the last nine years the Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC) has been organized and hosted
        annually. The VAHC workshop has been hosted five times at the IEEE VIS conference (2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, and
        2017) and four times at the AMIA Annual Symposium (2013, 2014, 2016, and 2018). This year the VAHC 2019 workshop
        is held in conjunction with the IEEE VIS conference in Vancouver, BC, Canada. For information about all previous
        VAHC events and to access the open-access proceedings from each of the previous workshops, please see
        <a href="prev_VAHC.html">past events</a>.
