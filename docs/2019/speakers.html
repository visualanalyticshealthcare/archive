            <b>Abstract:</b>
            <br>
            <p>There is a revolution in healthcare in which health decisions will be preventive, data-driven and
              personalized. Biomarker analysis gives us health insights like never before and allows us to take
              proactive measures to manage health.</p>
            <p>Visual analytics will play a key role in turning the vast amounts of health information into
              understandable, actionable insights. Molecular You is a digital health company developing an AI-driven
              playbook for personalized health to guide individuals to reach optimal health. The company has employed
              several visual analytic tools in its digital health platform to make the dynamic health information easy
              to understand for consumers and health practitioners.</p>
