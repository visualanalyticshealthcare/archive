			<!-- <h1> Call for Papers</h1>
			<p>The 2019 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2019) is the tenth annual workshop that provides an
				opportunity for participants to discuss state-of-the-art data visualization techniques and review how such
				techniques can be applied to healthcare data. The primary objective of the annual workshop is to bring together
				medical experts, leading scientists, and visionaries to discuss visualization techniques that can be applied to
				healthcare data and discuss the areas of healthcare that need more attention from the visualization and visual
				data mining communities. The workshop will enable participants to showcase their ongoing work on visual
				analytics of healthcare-related data through podium, posters, or demo presentations as well as to learn more
				about emerging techniques, software applications, and datasets. In years past, demos of prototype and/or
				production visual analytics software have been particularly well received, and paper submitters should also
				consider submitting a companion demo proposal.
				<br><br>
				During the last nine years the Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC) has been organized and hosted
				annually. The VAHC workshop has been hosted five times at the IEEE VIS conference (2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, and
				2017) and four times at the AMIA Annual Symposium (2013, 2014, 2016, and 2018). This year the VAHC 2019 workshop
				is held in conjunction with the IEEE VIS conference in Vancouver, BC, Canada. For information about all previous
				VAHC events and to access the open-access proceedings from each of the previous workshops, please see
				<a href="prev_VAHC.html">past events</a>. -->
			<h1>Topics and Scope</h1>
			<p>We will welcome discussions of the use of visual approaches, interaction design, statistical methods, and machine learning for healthcare data analysis. Participants may address the needs of a variety of users, including clinical researchers, epidemiologists, public health analysts, pharmaco-vigilance experts, physicians, hospital-based quality assurance officers, insurance claim analysts, and patients.
			</p>
			<p>
			Topics of interests include but are not limited to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Applications of visual analytics to:
					<ul>
						<li>Clinical care:
							<ul>
								<li>Prescription drugs and drug-drug interactions </li>
								<li>Longitudinal clinical data</li>
								<li>Visual data mining of EMRs </li>
								<li>Specific contexts, including surgery, radiology, emergency department, patient safety, mental health, and others.</li>
								<li>Clinical workflows</li>
								<li>Outcome forecasting or prediction</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Multi-omic datasets</li>
						<li>Patient-related applications:
							<ul>
								<li>Patient-generated health data</li>
								<li>Understanding of patient behavior and experience</li>
								<li>Patient education</li>
								<li>Physician-patient communication</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Public health data:
							<ul>
								<li>Pandemic forecasting and tracking</li>
								<li>Public health surveillance systems</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Human cognition</li>
				<li>Integration of visualization techniques and machine learning/artificial intelligence</li>

				<li>Human computer interaction</li>
				<li>Evaluation of visual analytics systems</li>
				<li><i>Visualizations for COVID-19</i></li>
			</ul>
			<p><i>COVID-19 Submissions</i>:  The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired a wide variety of visual approaches for gaining insight into outbreak trends, epidemiological forecasts, patient characteristics, social media data, and numerous other related aspects of this global phenomenon. COVID-19 submissions are highly encouraged. If there is sufficient interest, a special session related to COVID will be included in the workshop schedule.</p>


			<h1>Paper Submission and Format Guidelines</h1>
			<p>We encourage a diverse range of submissions and demonstrations from academia, healthcare organizations, and industry that address any of the topics listed above.
 
			As logistical arrangements for the workshop have not yet been made, agenda and format remain to be determined. However, we are hoping to support (1) paper / podium presentations, (2) poster presentations, and (3) live & interactive system demonstrations:

			<ul>
				<li><b>Paper:</b> submissions are limited to eight pages.
				</li>
				<li><b>Poster:</b> abstract submissions are limited to two pages.</li>
				<li><b>Demonstration:</b> abstract submissions are limited to two pages.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Updates will be provided as we work with the AMIA conference team to determine the exact schedule and nature of the workshop.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Accepted papers, poster, and demonstration abstracts will be included in the VAHC online proceedings.
			</p>
			<p>
			Note that workshops are not archival, and prior submission is allowed. We are accepting submissions for work previously accepted elsewhere to foster increased discussion and dissemination of ideas from a wide variety of venues.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 120%">Blind submissions are not required.</p>
