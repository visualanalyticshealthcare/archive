		<h1>CALL FOR PAPERS, POSTERS, and DEMONSTRATIONS</h1>
		<p>The 2021 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2021) is the 12th annual workshop that provides an opportunity for participants to discuss state-of-the-art data visualization techniques and review how such techniques can be applied to healthcare data. The primary objective of the workshop is to bring together leading scientists, medical experts, and visionaries to discuss: a) interactive visualization techniques that can be applied to healthcare data, b) areas of healthcare that need more attention from visualization and visual data analysis research, and c) emerging techniques, software applications, and datasets. The workshop will enable presenters to showcase their ongoing work through oral presentations and system demos. In years past, demos of prototype and/or production visual analytics software have been particularly well received, and paper submitters should also consider submitting a companion demo proposal.</p>

		<h1>TOPICS AND SCOPE</h1>

		<p>We welcome discussions of the use of visual approaches, interaction design, statistical methods, and machine learning for healthcare data analysis. Participants may address the needs of a variety of users, including clinical researchers, epidemiologists, public health analysts, pharmaco-vigilance experts, physicians, hospital-based quality assurance officers, insurance claim analysts, and patients.</p>

		<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualization of public health data
<li>Design principles of dashboards for public health programs
<li>Visual analysis and exploration of longitudinal clinical data
<li>Visual data mining of electronic medical records (EMRs)
<li>Visualization of drug-drug interactions
<li>Visual analytics for hospitals and emergency departments (ED)
<li>Outcome forecasting or prediction
<li>Visual analytics for patient safety
<li>Visual analytics in radiology
<li>Visualization of personal health or patient-generated data
<li>Improving physician-patient communication with visual analytics
<li>Visual analytics for medical knowledge discovery
<li>Human-computer interaction with EHRs
<li>Rigor and reproducibility
<li>Evaluation of visual analytics systems
<li>Visualizations for COVID-19
<li>Pandemic tracking and forecasting
<li>Learning from medical crises with visualization
</ul>	

<p><b>COVID-19 Submissions:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired a wide variety of visual approaches for gaining insight into outbreak trends, epidemiological forecasts, patient characteristics, social media data, and numerous other related aspects of this global phenomenon. COVID-19 submissions are highly encouraged. If there is sufficient interest, a special session related to COVID will be included in the workshop schedule.</p>
		
<h1>PAPER SUBMISSION AND FORMAT GUIDLINES</h1>

<p><b>VAHC 2021 will have a new paper format!</b> We will accept short papers with four pages plus one page of references (4+1). In addition, authors are encouraged to add additional figures to an appendix (A) section at the end of the manuscript. This allows authors to present more of their interesting visualization results at greater resolutions, resulting in the paper format "4+A+1".</p>

<p><b>VAHC will also have revised paper types!</b> We encourage a diverse range of submissions and demonstrations from academia, healthcare organizations, and industry in any of the short paper types listed below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Application papers (format: "4+A+1")
	<li>Research papers (format: "4+A+1")
	<li>Position and challenge papers (format: "2 up to 4+A+1")
	<li>System demo papers (format "2 up to 4+A+1" with an online video)
</ul>

<p>Accepted papers will be published in the IEEE Xplore digital library. Authors of accepted papers and abstracts can choose not to publish their paper on IEEE Xplore.</p>

<p>Accepted short papers will be included in the VAHC proceedings and made available via IEEE VIS or digital download.</p>

<p>Demo: Every short paper may be accompanied by an optional video demo submission.</d>

<p>All material should be submitted via the Precision Conference System (PCS):<br>
<a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?society=vgtc">https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?society=vgtc</a></p>
