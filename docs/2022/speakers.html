        Visualizing Beyond the Frontiers of Healthcare
      </p>
      </center>

      <p>
        “A picture is worth a thousand words.”  This is the time-honored adage that reflects the human brain’s immense capacity to efficiently receive and interpret visual information.  With the ever-increasing data quantity and complexity within healthcare, data visualization becomes an invaluable tool to enable healthcare providers and organizations to make informed decisions which optimize the health of individuals and the population, as well as business practices.  Furthermore, emerging capabilities such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) showcase the tremendous power of healthcare data analytics.  Visualization incorporating these capabilities harnesses this power, and truly pushes the frontiers of visual analytics and health informatics.  When it comes to the future of healthcare data visualization and data analytics, the sky is the limit.
